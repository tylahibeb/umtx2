# UMTX2 PS5 Host

> Custom fork of [idlesauce/umtx2](https://github.com/idlesauce/umtx2) with a modern UI and enhanced payload management.

**Disclaimer:** For educational and personal use only. Use at your own risk.

---

## What is this?

A web-based PS5 jailbreak host. Open it in your PS5 browser, pick your firmware, and go. No setup, no installation, no computer needed — just point your PS5 browser to the URL and you're set.

## Features

- **One-click jailbreak** — Select your firmware version, hit the button, done
- **Built-in payload manager** — Browse and send payloads directly from the UI, no extra tools needed
- **Auto-updating payloads** — Stays current with the latest releases from GitHub, updated twice daily
- **Multi-version support** — Pick specific payload versions, not just the latest
- **Firmware compatibility checks** — Warns you if a payload doesn't match your firmware
- **Settings & developer options** — Fine-tune your experience, hide payloads you don't use, enable debug mode
- **PS5-optimized UI** — Designed for DualSense navigation and the PS5 browser
- **Offline support** — AppCache lets you use it without an internet connection after the first load

## Supported Firmwares

1.00 through 5.50

## Payloads

20+ payloads ready to go:

etaHEN, elfldr, ftpsrv, websrv, gdbsrv, klogsrv, shsrv, ps5debug, ps5debug-dizz, byepervisor, backpork, kstuff, kstuff-toggle, libhijacker, ps5-versions, rp-get-pin, ShadowMountPlus, VoidShell, Sonic Loader, and more.

## How to Use

### Option A: Browser (recommended)

1. Open the host URL on your PS5 browser
2. Tap **Jailbreak** for full kernel exploit, or **Webkit-only** for sender-only mode
3. Select and run payloads from the menu
4. Hit the gear icon (top right) to manage settings — show/hide payloads, pick versions, check cache
5. Press **L2** to open the URL redirector

### Option B: PKG Install

1. Download `PPSX43000-KemalSanli UMTX 2.pkg` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kemalsanli/umtx2/releases)
2. Install the PKG on your jailbroken PS5 (via etaHEN, WebDAV, FTP, etc.)
3. Launch the app from your home screen — it opens the UMTX 2 host directly

## Hosting

Live at: [https://kemalsanli.github.io/umtx2/](https://kemalsanli.github.io/umtx2/)

### Custom Payload Repository (for PS5 Payload Manager)

This host also publishes its catalog as a JSON file in the format consumed by [itsPLK/ps5-payload-manager](https://github.com/itsPLK/ps5-payload-manager) (see `CUSTOM_REPOSITORIES.md`). To install the catalog in PS5 Payload Manager, open **Settings → Manage Sources → Add Source** and paste:

```
https://tylahibeb.github.io/umtx2/payloads.json
```

Catalog contents: one entry per visible payload (deprecated/`sourceType: custom` payloads are filtered out), pointing at the default/latest version. Each item includes an optional SHA-256 `checksum` for download verification and an auto-derived `category` (Networking / Game / Hack / Tools / Uncategorized).

### Self-hosted

If you'd rather run your own instance (LAN-only, custom domain, or fully offline / air-gapped), use the companion repo:

**[kemalsanli/umtx2-self-hosted](https://github.com/kemalsanli/umtx2-self-hosted)** — Docker scaffolding that mirrors this repo. `docker compose up -d --build` and point your PS5 browser at `http://<your-server>:8080`. An internal cron pulls fresh payload metadata twice a day, so your instance stays in sync without manual updates. For offline servers, every push to this repo automatically produces a self-contained bundle (scaffolding + frozen snapshot) under the [self-hosted releases](https://github.com/kemalsanli/umtx2-self-hosted/releases) — download, extract, run.

## Credits & Special Thanks

**Special thanks to [idlesauce](https://github.com/idlesauce)** for the original UMTX2 host — this project wouldn't exist without their work on the kernel exploit, payload system, and the entire host implementation.
